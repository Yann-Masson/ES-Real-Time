Question: Consider the computeSomething function, which has a fixed-length execution
time slightly equal to 1 tick. Remove the code while(t==ticks);, compile the code, and
boot the RPi using the newly created kernel

If we remove the code while(t==ticks);, the function computeSomething will terminate faster
than 1 tick because it's doesn't wait for the next tick. (It terminate too soon).
